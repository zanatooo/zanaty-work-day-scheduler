# zanaty-work-day-scheduler
This is a daily planner to create a schedule. when I open the planner, I can find the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
when I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours, and I can view the time blocks for that day. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a time block, I can enter an event.
When I click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage, and when I refresh the page, the saved events stay.
